# webcam-motion-detector
The app compares consecutive video frames to detect movement, when motion is detected, the video frame will highlight with a red border
You can adjust sensitivity slider to make motion detection more or less sensitive

## Purpose

First step in a personal project for broader development, where I would like to leave the tablet with this app running and when it detects a face using [TensorFlow.js and Face-API.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/) for accurate face detection
